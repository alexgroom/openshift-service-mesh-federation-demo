# This Helm values are for your 2nd OpenShift Cluster. Adjust the values according
# to you own environment. REMEMBER to also update the values for 1st OpenShift cluster
# in the values-cluster-1.yaml file.
#
# Notes:
#
# 1.  Since the service mesh will dynamically generate other K8S objects based 
#     on your mesh name, and such name will be prefixed with some strings which
#     cannot exceed certain amount of characters. Thus, suggest not to have a 
#     mesh name more than 8 characters.
#
# 2.  You may change mesh version to a newer version if available and if compatible.
# 
# 3.  For nodeport, be aware that you must pick a port number which is above 30000
#     and cannot be in used.
#
# 4.  remote-mesh.peering-addresses is an array list. You may list all the IP 
#     addresses of your worker nodes which has nodeport exposed, or other FQDNS 
#     like public cloud load balancers.
